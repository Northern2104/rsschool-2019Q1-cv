**Why do I want to become a full web developer?**

First and foremost, because I like it. I like to set tasks and solve them. Challenging brings great joy.

Secondly, I am in my heart a little creator and a little mathematician. And this profession, like no other, combines the use of creative skills and the ability to think logically.

And third, I want a stable future for myself and my family.

I am ready for difficulties, I am ready to independently improve my skill and learn, looking at the work of experienced comrades.
